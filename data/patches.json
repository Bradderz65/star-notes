These Asteroid Bases will have gameplay features such as turrets and gas tanks for use in the various missions but do not have an interior.",
            "Unattended Vehicle Quantum Travel",
            "Added the ability for players to locate and directly quantum travel to their own, unattended vehicles in the PU. This update will allow players who have a ship that is not destroyed or in soft-death to be able to get back to their main capital ship in space when using a shuttle to get to planet surfaces or allow them to find their way back to their ship that they lost after dying.",
            "This content delivery is focused around developing a new set of missions featuring ship combat. Each mission will have improved scenario design and leverage new technology to allow us to improve the narrative flow of missions. The goal is to deliver missions with superior scenario design and a greater level of polish and attention to detail.",
            "The Patrol mission takes the player through a series of patrol points. Patrol missions will be offered by Foxwell Enforcement (Legal) and the Head Hunters (Illegal). At each point a semi-random event occurs and escalating ship archetypes may appear depending on mission difficulty and previous events. These missions are gated by location to reduce unnecessary travel time. If you are at Stanton 1 then all the missions you are offered will send you somewhere around Stanton 1. This is to reduce the need for excessive QT times and shift the balance of the QT/gameplay ratio towards engaging with content. Each level of difficulty also has a chance to spawn an Ace Pilot who is an elite member of the Frontier Fighters willing to die for their cause. Foxwell offer legal missions against criminals. These will not have a reputation structure and progression will instead be gated by completing early missions a number or times to unlock later ones. Currently any player without a crimestat will move up to the next rank after 5 of each completed mission until Very Hard and Extreme difficulties which will require 10 of the previous to unlock. Head Hunters offer illegal missions for Patrol. Any missions offered by Head Hunters in Stanton will be displayed in the Unverified tab and risk sending players against security forces and civilians, giving them a crime stat. They will award an increased amount to offset this risk. Head Hunters has an existing reputation structure, starting with Very Easy Rank 1 and escalating to Extreme at Rank 5+.",
            "The addition of a new Ship Battle Mission type known as Ambush Missions. Players must reach a location, head to a spot where their signature will be masked, power down their ship and wait for the hostiles to arrive. Once their targets arrive, the player must attack and destroy all of them. Ambush missions are offered by Foxwell Enforcement (Legal) and the Head Hunters (Criminal). Foxwell offer legal missions against criminals. Any missions offered by Head Hunters in Stanton will be displayed in the Unverified tab and risk sending players against security forces and civilians, giving them a crime stat. They will award an increased amount to offset this risk.",
            "These new Foxwell combat progression style missions from Gilly send players through multiple scenarios of ship vs ship combat.Players are tasked with an implicit mission chain where we introduce new challenges and let the player figure their way through things rather than hold their hand every step of the way. The missions are intended to be for players who already know how to fly and are at least somewhat familiar with the game, but don\u2019t necessarily engage in much, if any, ship combat at all.There are 8 total scenarios to unlock and progress through with increasing difficulty and complexity.",
